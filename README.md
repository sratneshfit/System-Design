## 📝 Overview
This project implements a **Web Application Firewall (WAF) or Load Balancer**, designed to:
- **Protect against malicious web traffic** (WAF)
- **Distribute network traffic efficiently** (Load Balancer)
- **Ensure high availability and fault tolerance**

It supports **multiple filtering techniques (for WAF)** and **load balancing algorithms (for Load Balancer)**.

---

## ✨ Features
### **✔ Web Application Firewall (WAF)**
- SQL Injection, XSS, and DDoS protection
- Rate limiting & IP blacklisting
- Customizable filtering rules

### **✔ Load Balancer**
- Round Robin, Least Connections, and IP Hash algorithms
- Health checks for backend servers
- Connection persistence support

### **✔ General Features**
- Configurable rules via JSON/YAML
- Logging & monitoring support
- Multi-threaded request handling

---

## 🖥️ Architecture
### **📌 For WAF**
1. Intercepts incoming requests
2. Parses HTTP headers and payloads
3. Applies security rules
4. Blocks or forwards requests

### **📌 For Load Balancer**
1. Accepts client requests
2. Selects a backend server using an algorithm
3. Forwards request & returns the response

### **🔧 Tech Stack**
- **Language:** C++ (Multithreading, Networking)
- **Networking:** Sockets, HTTP handling
- **Security:** Regex filters, IP Blacklist
- **Logging & Monitoring:** Prometheus, Grafana (optional)

---

## 🚀 Installation
### **🔹 Prerequisites**
- C++ Compiler (`g++` or `clang`)
- `cmake` for building
- `libpcap` (for WAF traffic analysis)

### **🔹 Build & Run**
```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/waf-loadbalancer.git  
cd waf-loadbalancer  
mkdir build && cd build  
cmake ..  
make  
./waf OR ./load_balancer
```

---

## 📌 Usage
### **🔹 Running WAF**
```sh
./waf --config rules.json --port 8080
```
- Blocks malicious requests based on `rules.json`.

### **🔹 Running Load Balancer**
```sh
./load_balancer --algorithm round_robin --servers backend_servers.json
```
- Balances traffic using Round Robin.

---

## 📊 Performance & Scaling
- Multi-threaded request processing
- Caching for repeated requests
- Supports horizontal scaling

---

## 🔮 Future Enhancements
- Add AI-based anomaly detection
- Implement gRPC support
- Cloud-native deployment (Kubernetes, AWS)
